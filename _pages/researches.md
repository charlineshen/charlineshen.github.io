## Machine Learning & Computer Vision Researcher | Army Research Laboratory
_09/2021 - Present_

Research focus: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Synthetic-to-real Translation; Professor: [Suya You](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273287300)

- Trained and evaluated different setups of a synthetic-to-real generative model that transforms the synthetic renderings into more realistic styles on general-purpose datasets conditioned with unlabeled real-world data
- Used Tensorflow and Keras to implement a Generative Adversarial Network
- Conducted extensive performance evaluations through FID and SSIM metrics and through downstream object detection/semantic segmentation tasks

## Undergraduate Researcher | Berkeley Lab
_09/2021 - Present_

Research focus: Scientific Machine Learning(SciML), Surrogate Modeling; Professor: [Duncan Callaway](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/dcal.html)

- Explored the application of continuous-time echo state networks (CTESNs) for learning a surrogate to predict the time-domain solution of a dynamic power system for varying system parameters
- Implemented non-linear projection CTESN using Julia and benchmark it against the linear projection CTESN
- Implemented cross-validation based adaptive sampling and compare it with gradient-based and query-by-committee active sampling; benchmarked their accuracy and computational costs against a simple space-filling approach
- Evaluated the performance on HPC for a dynamic power system application

## Undergraduate Researcher | Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology
_01/2021 - 12/2021_

Research job: Implement and Maintain SCETâ€™s [innovation index survey system](https://innovationindex.berkeley.edu/); Professor: [Ikhlaq Sidhu](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/ikhlaq-sidhu)

- Used webhooks and Google app scripts to create a survey system that collects, processes surveys, and gives feedback to the users; built an efficient pipeline that could handle concurrent requests
- Deployed the survey on Anvil; built an interactive interface with a recommender system for survey distributors
- Customized the system to other entities

## Undergraduate Researcher | Creative Commons

Research topic: [image popularity and authority](https://ds-discovery.github.io/Projects/Platforms_Infrastructure/Image%20Popularity%20and%20Authority/); Github: [repo](https://github.com/creativecommons/data-science-playground/tree/main/Image%20Popularity%20and%20Authority); Mentor: [Brent Moran](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Brent-Moran/3467456051)

- Used Python, SQL, pandas to scrape, process, and organize PBs of image data
- Embedded image data into vectors using Bert Model and ran MLP Regressor on them to train and predict
- Extracted a single layer from VGG16 model to recognize and classify large image data
