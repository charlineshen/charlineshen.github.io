## [Optimizing Magnetic Field Trap Computation for Antihydrogen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16grSJuy2Gphl5TAEhlk5HCMun93JkS4O/view?usp=share_link)
_2023 spring_

- Project done in Berkeley Plasma Antihydrogen Physics Research Group (Professor: [Jonathan Wurtele](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jonathan-wurtele))
- Used machine learning to simulate the magnetic field needed to trap antihydrogen that is created by Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus (ALPHA) collaboration at CERN
- Precomputed magnetic field accurately by Biot-Savart model from ALPHA-g experiment, visualized B-field
distribution, and fit to multiple machine learning models with data augmentation for comparision


## [Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://github.com/JohnsonJDDJ/CS182_PINN)
_12/2022_

Used Jax to implement and reproduce the key concepts and
frameworks of the paper [Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999118307125).

## Baby Cry Detection and Classification
_09/2023 - present_

- Developed an application that can identify baby cry audios and the reason of baby cry, based on Dunstan Baby Language
- Built a full MLOps pipeline with a blend use of Docker containers, DVC version control, Weights & Biases experiment tracking,
Kubeflow, Vertex AI serverless training, google cloud vm and storage, APIs, and frontend implementation

## [Constrain Cosmological Parameters using Supernovae](https://github.com/charlineshen/Constraining-Cosmological-Parameters-using-Supernovae)
_04/2023_ 

Used supernovae data to fit equations to constrain cosmological parameters.


## Object Recognition
_04/2022_

Used Pytorch to train a CNN Network on CIFAR-10 with data augmentation, regularization, dropout, and weight initialization; top 10% on Kaggle competition

## Pintos Operating System 
_2021 fall_

Built a Pintos operating system that has user processes, multi-thread managements, and file systems in C language.

## RookieDB
_2021 fall_

- Built a bare-bones database in Java which supports executing transactions in series
- Implemented support for B+ tree indices, efficient join algorithms, query optimization, multi granularity locking, and database recovery

## Pac Man
_04/2021_

Made Pac-Man game using python and implemented a series of artificial intelligence techniques
to play Pac-Man, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.

## [Emooc](https://devpost.com/software/emooc)
_10/2019_

A Cal Hacks 6.0 project that help students and instructors identify difficult parts in online lectures by interpreting facial expressions.
