## [Optimizing Magnetic Field Trap Computation for Antihydrogen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16grSJuy2Gphl5TAEhlk5HCMun93JkS4O/view?usp=share_link)
_2023 spring_

- Project done in Berkeley Plasma Antihydrogen Physics Research Group (Professor: [Jonathan Wurtele](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jonathan-wurtele))
- Used machine learning to simulate the magnetic field needed to trap antihydrogen that is created by Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus (ALPHA) collaboration at CERN
- Precomputed magnetic field accurately by Biot-Savart model from ALPHA-g experiment, visualized B-field
distribution, and fit to multiple machine learning models with data augmentation for comparision


## [Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://github.com/JohnsonJDDJ/CS182_PINN)
_12/2022_

Used Jax to implement and reproduce the key concepts and
frameworks of the paper [Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999118307125).

## Object Recognition
_04/2022_

Used Pytorch to train a CNN Network on CIFAR-10 with data augmentation, regularization, dropout, and weight initialization; top 10% on Kaggle competition

## Pac Man
_04/2021_

Made Pac-Man game using python and implemented a series of artificial intelligence techniques
to play Pac-Man, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.
