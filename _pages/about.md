Hi! I am Tingwei Shen. I also go by Charline. I'm a fourth year undergraduate student in UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Physics. I am currently researching under Army Research Laboratory and under Energy Modeling, Analysis and Control Group (EMAC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

I'm interested in areas around computer vision and machine learning, especially scientific machine learning. Particularly, I hope to explore the interplay between physics and machine learning. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HbRoCy-eJX0xKG-89V4NrIC1EERlU2Yx/view?usp=sharing).

Outside of academics, I love cooking, baking, and traveling. I also pay close attention to woman in STEM and take my mission to empower woman in technology.
