Hii! I am Tingwei Shen. I also go by Charline. I'm a first year master's student at Harvard University's Computational Science and Engineering program. I just graduated from UC Berkeley, studied Computer Science and Physics. My experiences are mostly software engineering-related(with several software engineer internships) and research-related, particularly in the area of computer vision and scientific machine learning. Currently, I am looking forward to finding a software/data/ML engineer position!

Recently, I am interested in research areas around computational physics and physics-based machine learning. Particularly, I hope to explore the interplay between physics and machine learning. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HbRoCy-eJX0xKG-89V4NrIC1EERlU2Yx/view?usp=sharing).

Outside of academics, I love cooking, baking, traveling, and playing board games and video games! I am passinate about empowering woman in technology and co-founded [Girls Who Code @ Berkeley](https://gwcberkeley.github.io/).
