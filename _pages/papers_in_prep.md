## A Study on Improving Realism of Synthetic Data for Machine Learning
_Keywords: Synthetic data, Domain gap, Generative adversarial learning, Synthetic-to-real translation_

Synthetic-to-real data translation using generative adversarial learning has achieved significant success to improve synthetic data. Yet, there are limited studies focusing on deep evaluation and comparison of different adversarial training on general-purpose synthetic data for machine learning. This work aims to train and evaluate different setups of a synthetic-to-real generative model that transforms the synthetic renderings into more realistic styles on general-purpose datasets conditioned with unlabeled real-world data. Extensive performance evaluation and comparison have been conducted through qualitative and quantitative metrics, and a defined downstream perception task.

## Synthetic Image Refinement by Unsupervised Bidirectional Adversarial Learning
_Keywords: Synthetic image refinement, Cycle generative adversarial network, Unsupervised learning_

This paper proposes an unsupervised generative learning approach to improve the realism of synthetic images. The new approach is a bidirectional mapping architecture consisting of two adversarial learning paths including the synthetic-to-real path and the real-to-synthetic path. To make the distribution of synthetic and real data closer, multiple loss functions including adversarial loss, consistency loss, and content-specific loss are employed in both paths. By learning the bidirectional mappings between two unpaired domains, the realism of the input synthetic images is significantly improved. Extensive performance evaluation and comparison are conducted through qualitative and quantitative metrics.

## Active Sampling Strategies for Power System Surrogates
_Keywords: Data-driven modeling techniques, active learning, machine learning, power system dynamics_

With the growing penetration of converter interfaced generation in power systems, the dynamical behavior of these systems is rapidly evolving. One of the challenges with converter-interfaced generation is the increased number of equations, as well as the required numerical timestep, involved
in simulating these systems. Within this work, we explore the use of surrogate modeling to cheaply, and accurately, predict the dynamic response of power systems subject to a disturbance for varying system parameters. We consider different active learning strategies that try to minimize the training data requirements for building a sufficiently accurate surrogate.
