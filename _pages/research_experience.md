## Machine Learning & Computer Vision Researcher | Army Research Laboratory
_09/2021 - Present_

Research focus: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Synthetic-to-real Translation; Professor: [Suya You](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37273287300)

- Trained and evaluated different setups of a synthetic-to-real generative model that transforms the synthetic renderings into more realistic styles on general-purpose datasets conditioned with unlabeled real-world data
- Used Tensorflow and Keras to implement a Generative Adversarial Network
- Conducted extensive performance evaluations through FID and SSIM metrics and through downstream object detection/semantic segmentation tasks

## Undergraduate Researcher | ReDAS Lab, University of Houston
_06/2021 - Present_

Research focus: Deception Detection, NLP; Mentor: [Dr. Rekash Verma](http://cs.uh.edu/~rmverma/)

- Implemented and experimented with various feature engineering algorithms, ML and DL models in NLP.

- Compiled a cross-domain deception dataset with fake reviews, fake opinions, phishing emails, and fake news.

- Trained BERT models on the cross-domain dataset to show the possibility of domain-independent deception detection with results published in [CODASPY 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508398.3519358).

## Application Engineering Intern | Oak Ridge National Lab
_06/2022 - 08/2022_

Research focus: Productivity and Sustainability in Software Engineering; Mentor: Dr. Gregory R. Watson

- Developed a website, [rateyourproject.org](https://rateyourproject.org/), to help users improve software engineering practices while collecting research data.

- Concluded my findings in internally-reviewed [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UsETMKP-TNkK4i4IfygxFC4ElilItJqw/view?usp=sharing) and [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jovph43gkaLYsOPq3QekxjTqZPwXHlh9/view?usp=sharing).

## Research Apprentice | Oski Lab, UC Berkeley
_09/2020 - 06/2021_

Project: [NLP for Cannabis Text Data](https://ds-discovery.github.io/Projects/Social%20Sciences/NLP%20for%20Cannabis%20Text%20Data/); Mentor: Dr. Cyrus Dioun

- Used Beautiful Soup to scrape product data from websites; pre-processed and merged data.
- Used NLP methods to find trends and patterns in product description data about cannabis, trying to uncover the
political and cultural elements that affect market competition in the US cannabis industry.

## Research Apprentice | Berkeley Law School
_03/2020 - 09/2020_

Project: [Why Companies Rebrand](https://ds-discovery.github.io/Projects/Industry_Economics/Empirical%20Examination%20of%20Corporate%20Rebranding%20and%20Trademarks/); Mentor: Dr. Sonia Katyal

- Extracted useful information from almost 1 PB of patent applications of 4000 companies in 100 years from USTPO and 10-K files from SEC, using bag-of-words and sentiment analysis.
